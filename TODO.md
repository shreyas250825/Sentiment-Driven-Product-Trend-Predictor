## Implementation Summary
The PDF export functionality has been successfully implemented:

### Backend Changes:
1. **requirements.txt**: Added `reportlab==4.0.7` for PDF generation
2. **routes/analysis.py**: 
   - Added necessary imports for PDF generation
   - Created new POST `/api/compare/export` endpoint
   - Implemented comprehensive PDF report generation including:
     - Executive summary with best performing product analysis
     - Detailed comparison table with sentiment, confidence, trend, and sample size
     - Recommendations based on analysis data
     - Professional formatting with colors and styling

### Frontend Integration:
The frontend `ProductComparison.jsx` already calls the correct endpoint (`/api/compare/export`) with the selected products, so no frontend changes are needed.

### How it works:
1. User selects products in the ProductComparison page
2. Clicks "Export PDF" button
3. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/compare/export` with selected products
4. Backend retrieves analysis data from Firestore
5. Generates professional PDF report with comparison details
6. Returns PDF file for download

### Testing:
To test the functionality:
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python main.py`
2. Start the frontend: `cd src && npm start`
3. Navigate to ProductComparison page
4. Select products and click "Export PDF"

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
